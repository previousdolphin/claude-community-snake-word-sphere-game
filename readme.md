## The Hook

Snake on a sphere. Collect orbs to reveal letters. Solve the word before you crash. Like in a real 3d world, the snake can climb over itself. It will die when it runs into walls. Also there's portals.

Navigation is done with touch on mobile, and works with WASD or the Arrow Keys on a desktop with keyboard. 

Made in about 20 seconds!
